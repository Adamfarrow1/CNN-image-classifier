# CNN Image Classifier

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Python and TensorFlow/Keras to classify images into different categories. Itâ€™s a great starting point for understanding the fundamentals of deep learning and computer vision.

## Project Overview

The notebook includes the following steps:

- Loading and preprocessing an image dataset
- Building a CNN architecture
- Training the model
- Evaluating its performance
- Making predictions on new data

## Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Features

- Modular CNN model using Keras
- Dataset loading and normalization
- Visualization of training and validation accuracy/loss
- Prediction on new or custom images

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following packages are installed:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib


### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cnn-image-classifier.git

2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook cnn_image_classifier.ipynb



3. Run through the cells to train and evaluate your CNN model.

## Sample Output

The notebook includes visualizations such as training accuracy and loss curves. You can also test the model on new images.

## Customization

You can easily modify the project to:

- Use a different image dataset
- Extend the CNN architecture
- Add data augmentation
- Export the model for use in other applications
